# ISpeed-Microscopy

## Johns Hopkins University ISPEED Program

Welcome to the ISPEED program at Johns Hopkins University. I'm Mantej Singh (msingh44@jhu.edu) and I am your instructor for the optics/microscopy program in ISPEED. Due to the success of the program in 2023, I have created this repository where anyone, around the world, can build their own microscope and image the world around them.

In this repository, you will find

1. Instructions
2. Parts Lists
3. Code and Examples

Please feel free to email me during and even after the course if you have any questions, ideas or need help in building really cool inventions.
